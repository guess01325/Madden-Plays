## API and Data Sample

https://api.airtable.com/v0/appzTRr5Ju0pMpe1m/plays


Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rec6e9pgryDN8vHQs",
            "fields": {},
            "createdTime": "2021-08-20T19:43:48.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recGjIowXQBMzBQAD",
            "fields": {},
            "createdTime": "2021-08-20T19:39:12.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recMoPBHoc8m1m8vO",
            "fields": {
                "formation": "Single Back",
                "play": "PA Verts",
                "team": "Cowboys"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-08-20T19:39:12.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "reccLE7irhuo4vMoI",
            "fields": {
                "formation": "Single Back",
                "play": "HB Stretch",
                "team": "Packers"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-08-20T19:39:12.000Z"
        }
    ]
}

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Aug 19| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes|
|Aug 20| Project Approval |
|Aug 23| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) 
|Aug 24| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Aug 25| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Aug 26| MVP | Incomplete
|Aug 27| Presentations | Incomplete


## Timeframes

I plan to spend 3 hours on each component and I plan to code for 8 hours a day including mvp 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Code app component | H | 3hrs| 4hrs | 3hrs |
| Code nav components | H | 3hrs| 4hrs | 3hrs |
| Code plays component | H | 3hrs| 4hrs | 3hrs|
| Code form component | H | 3hrs| 4hrs | 3hrs|
| Code axios post/delete | H | 3hrs| 4hrs| 3hrs|
| Make component with plays| 3hrs| 3hrs| 3hrs|
| Cake buttons| 3hrs| 3hrs| 3hrs|


| Total | H | 21 hrs| 26 hrs | 21 hrs |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I can code pretty well and understand logic 
### Weaknesses:
probably would be post mvp, and always sruggle with axios calls for some reason and getting in the death of data types.
### Opportunities:
My opportunity is that I will be able to learn more about all this stuff and have a complete project to show future employers. 
### Threats:
Threat I have is time management, I get caught up in tyring to uderstand to deep instead on working on priority, but I am getting better at that. 
### Results
I will stay on schedule and and push myself to be as creative as I can and push my limits during mvp.
