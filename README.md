## API and Data Sample

https://api.airtable.com/v0/appzTRr5Ju0pMpe1m/plays


Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Liz Yrineo",
                "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
                "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
            "fields": {
                "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",

            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        },
        {

            "fields": {

                "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
            },
            "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
        }
    ],

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- code app component
- code nav component
- code plays component
- code forms component
- code axios post
- make plays compenent

- 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites
